## Image classification using machine learning in Google Earth Engine
* Zach Levitt, Middlebury College

This tutorial will introduce a workflow for classifying remotely-sensed imagery using machine learning approaches in Google Earth Engine. Google Earth Engine is an open repository of planetary-scale satellite imagery with built-in methods for analysis, visualization, and classification. We will usebuilt-in GEE imagery such as NAIP and Sentinel imagery, as well as topographic variables derived from uploaded LiDAR, to develop a novel image classification methodology. In this tutorial, we will apply these tools to classify vegetation classes on the Channel Islands of California, though the tools are applicable to a wide range of use cases. We will utilize both supervised and unsupervised classification methods on spectral, topographic and spatial variables in order to improve the accuracy of the classification.

### Background

There are two primary motiviations for this work:

1. Update a 2007 map of vegetation classes on Santa Cruz Island (the largest of the Channel Islands)
2. Apply machine learning approaches to identify vegetation classes using topographic, spectral and spatial variables.

### Data inputs
* Satellite imagery (NAIP, Sentinel)
* Elevation data (LiDAR)
